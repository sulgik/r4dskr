# 스프레드시트 {#import-spreadsheets}

## 들어가기

지금까지 우리는 플레인 텍스트 파일들, 즉 `.csv`, `.tsv` 파일들을 불러오는 것에 대해 배웠었다. 어떤 경우에는 스프레드시트에 있는 데이터를 분석해야 할 때가 있을 것이다. 
이번 장에서 엑셀 스프레드시트와 구글 시트 데이터와 작업하는 도구에 대해 소개할 것이다.
\@ref(data-import) 장과 \@ref(import-rectangular) 장에서 배운 것을 기반으로 이루어질 것이지만 스프레드시트 데이터로 작업할 때 생기는 추가적인 고려사항과 복잡성에 대해서도 논의할 것이다.

여러분, 혹은 여러분의 동료가 스프레드시트를 이용해서 데이터를 정리하고 있다면, Karl Broman 과 Kara Woo 이 쓴 논문, "Data Organization in Spreadsheets" 를 읽어보기를 강력히 추천한다: <https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989>.
이 페이퍼에서 제공한 가장 좋은 실천방법을 따르면, 분석과 시각화를 위해 데이터를 스프레드시트에서 R 로 읽어올 때 훨씬 머리가 덜 아프게 만들어 줄 것이다.

## 엑셀

### 준비하기

In this chapter, you'll learn how to load data from Excel spreadsheets in R with the **readxl** package.
This package is non-core tidyverse, so you need to load it explicitly but it is installed automatically when you install the tidyverse package.

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
```

**xlsx** 과 **XLConnect** 을 사용하여 엑셀 스프레드시트에서 데이터를 읽거나 쓸 수 있다.
그러나, 이 두 패키지는 컴퓨터에 Java 가 설치되어 있고, rJava 패키지가 있어야 한다.
설치할 때 문제가 생길 수 있으므로, 이 장에서 소개하는 다른 패키지들을 사용하길 추천한다.

### 시작하기

readxl 함수 대부분을 사용하여 엑셀 스프레드시트를 R 로 가져올 수 있다:

-   `read_xls()` reads Excel files with `xls` format.
-   `read_xlsx()` read Excel files with `xlsx` format.
-   `read_excel()` can read files with both `xls` and `xlsx` format. It guesses the file type based on the input.

이 함수들은 앞서 다른 종류의 파일을 읽는데 소개한 `read_csv()`, `read_table()` 과 같은 다른 함수과 유사한 문법을 갖는다.
이번 장 나머지 부분에서는 `read_excel()` 사용하는 법에 집중하도록 한다.

### 스프레드시트 읽어오기

R 로 읽어올 스프레드시트는 엑셀에서 Figure \@ref(fig:students-excel) 과 같이 생겼다.

```{r students-excel, fig.alt = "A look at the students spreadsheet in Excel. The spreadsheet contains information on 6 students, their ID, full name, favourite food, meal plan, and age.", fig.cap = "Spreadsheet called students.xlsx in Excel.", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/import-spreadsheets-students.png")
```

`read_excel()` 첫번째 인수는 읽을 파일의 경로이다.

```{r}
students <- read_excel("data/students.xlsx")
```

`read_excel()` 은 파일을 티블로 읽는다.

```{r}
students
```

데이터에는 학생 여섯이 있고 각 학생마다 변수 다섯개가 있다.
하지만 이 데이터셋에 관해 이야기 하고 싶은 것 몇개가 있다.

1.  The column names are all over the place.
    You can provide column names that follow a consistent format; we recommend `snake_case` using the `col_names` argument.

    ```{r}
    read_excel(
      "data/students.xlsx",
      col_names = c("student_id", "full_name", "favourite_food", "meal_plan", "age")
    )
    ```

    Unfortunately, this didn't quite do the trick.
    You now have the variable names we want, but what was previously the header row now shows up as the first observation in the data.
    You can explicitly skip that row using the `skip` argument.

    ```{r}
    read_excel(
      "data/students.xlsx",
      col_names = c("student_id", "full_name", "favourite_food", "meal_plan", "age"),
      skip = 1
    )
    ```

2.  In the `favourite_food` column, one of the observations is `N/A`, which stands for "not available" but it's currently not recognized as an `NA` (note the contrast between this `N/A` and the age of the fourth student in the list).
    You can specify which character strings should be recognized as `NA`s with the `na` argument.
    By default, only `""` (empty string, or, in the case of reading from a spreadsheet, an empty cell) is recognized as an `NA`.

    ```{r}
    read_excel(
      "data/students.xlsx",
      col_names = c("student_id", "full_name", "favourite_food", "meal_plan", "age"),
      skip = 1,
      na = c("", "N/A")
    )
    ```

3.  One other remaining issue is that `age` is read in as a character variable, but it really should be numeric.
    Just like with `read_csv()` and friends for reading data from flat files, you can supply a `col_types` argument to `read_excel()` and specify the column types for the variables you read in.
    The syntax is a bit different, though.
    Your options are `"skip"`, `"guess"`, `"logical"`, `"numeric"`, `"date"`, `"text"` or `"list"`.

    ```{r}
    read_excel(
      "data/students.xlsx",
      col_names = c("student_id", "full_name", "favourite_food", "meal_plan", "age"),
      skip = 1,
      na = c("", "N/A"),
      col_types = c("numeric", "text", "text", "text", "numeric")
    )
    ```

    However, this didn't quite produce the desired result either.
    By specifying that `age` should be numeric, we have turned the one cell with the non-numeric entry (which had the value `five`) into an `NA`.
    In this case, we should read age in as `"text"` and then make the change once the data is loaded in R.

    ```{r}
    students <- read_excel(
      "data/students.xlsx",
      col_names = c("student_id", "full_name", "favourite_food", "meal_plan", "age"),
      skip = 1,
      na = c("", "N/A"),
      col_types = c("numeric", "text", "text", "text", "text")
    )

    students <- students %>%
      mutate(
        age = if_else(age == "five", "5", age),
        age = parse_number(age)
      )

    students
    ```

It took us multiple steps and trial-and-error to load the data in exactly the format we want, and this is not unexpected.
Data science is an iterative process.
There is no way to know exactly what the data will look like until you load it and take a look at it.
Well, there is one way, actually.
You can open the file in Excel and take a peek.
That might be tempting, but it's strongly not recommended.
<!--# TO DO: Provide reason why it's not recommended. --> Instead, you should not be afraid of doing what we did here: load the data, take a peek, make adjustments to your code, load it again, and repeat until you're happy with the result.

### 개별 시트 읽어오기

An important feature that distinguishes spreadsheets from flat files is the notion of multiple sheets.
Figure \@ref(fig:penguins-islands) shows an Excel spreadsheet with multiple sheets.
The data come from the **palmerpenguins** package.
Each sheet contains information on penguins from a different island where data were collected.

```{r penguins-islands, fig.alt = "A look at the penguins spreadsheet in Excel. The spreadsheet contains has three sheets: Torgersen Island, Biscoe Island, and Dream Island.", fig.cap = "Spreadsheet called penguins.xlsx in Excel.", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/import-spreadsheets-penguins-islands.png")
```

You can read a single sheet from a spreadsheet with the `sheet` argument in `read_excel()`.

```{r}
read_excel("data/penguins.xlsx", sheet = "Torgersen Island")
```

Some variables that appear to contain numerical data are read in as characters due to the character string `"NA"` not being recognized as a true `NA`.

```{r}
penguins_torgersen <- read_excel("data/penguins.xlsx", sheet = "Torgersen Island", na = "NA")

penguins_torgersen
```

However, we cheated here a bit.
We looked inside the Excel spreadsheet, which is not a recommended workflow.
Instead, you can use `excel_sheets()` to get information on all sheets in an Excel spreadsheet, and then read the one(s) you're interested in.

```{r}
excel_sheets("data/penguins.xlsx")
```

Once you know the names of the sheets, you can read them in individually with `read_excel()`.

```{r}
penguins_biscoe <- read_excel("data/penguins.xlsx", sheet = "Biscoe Island", na = "NA")
penguins_dream  <- read_excel("data/penguins.xlsx", sheet = "Dream Island", na = "NA")
```

In this case the full penguins dataset is spread across three sheets in the spreadsheet.
Each sheet has the same number of columns but different numbers of rows.

```{r}
dim(penguins_torgersen)
dim(penguins_biscoe)
dim(penguins_dream)
```

We can put them together with `bind_rows()`.

```{r}
penguins <- bind_rows(penguins_torgersen, penguins_biscoe, penguins_dream)
penguins
```

In Chapter \@ref(iteration) we'll talk about ways of doing this sort of task without repetitive code <!--# Check to make sure that's the right place to present it -->.

### Reading part of a sheet

Since many use Excel spreadsheets for presentation as well as for data storage, it's quite common to find cell entries in a spreadsheet that are not part of the data you want to read into R.
Figure \@ref(fig:deaths-excel) shows such a spreadsheet: in the middle of the sheet is what looks like a data frame but there is extraneous text in cells above and below the data.

```{r deaths-excel, fig.alt = "A look at the deaths spreadsheet in Excel. The spreadsheet has four rows on top that contain non-data information; the text 'For the same of consistency in the data layout, which is really a beautiful thing, I will keep making notes up here.' is spread across cells in these top four rows. Then, there is a data frame that includes information on deaths of 10 famous people, including their names, professions, ages, whether they have kids r not, date of birth and death. At the bottom, there are four more rows of non-data information; the text 'This has been really fun, but we're signing off now!' is spread across cells in these bottom four rows.", fig.cap = "Spreadsheet called deaths.xlsx in Excel.", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/import-spreadsheets-deaths.png")
```

This spreadsheet is one of the example spreadsheets provided in the readxl package.
You can use the `readxl_example()` function to locate the spreadsheet on your system in the directory where the package is installed.
This function returns the path to the spreadsheet, which you can use in `read_excel()` as usual.

```{r}
deaths_path <- readxl_example("deaths.xlsx")
deaths <- read_excel(deaths_path)
deaths
```

맨 위 세 행과 맨 아래 네 행은 데이터프레임의 부분이 아니다.

맨 위 행들은 `skip` 으로 건너뛸 수 있다.
Note that we set `skip = 4` since the fourth row contains column names, not the data.

```{r}
read_excel(deaths_path, skip = 4)
```

We could also set `n_max` to omit the extraneous rows at the bottom.

```{r}
read_excel(deaths_path, skip = 4, n_max = 10)
```

Another approach is using cell ranges.
In Excel, the top left cell is `A1`.
As you move across columns to the right, the cell label moves down the alphabet, i.e.
`B1`, `C1`, etc.
And as you move down a column, the number in the cell label increases, i.e.
`A2`, `A3`, etc.

The data we want to read in starts in cell `A5` and ends in cell `F15`.
In spreadsheet notation, this is `A5:F15`.

-   Supply this information to the `range` argument:

    ```{r results = "hide"}
    read_excel(deaths_path, range = "A5:F15")
    ```

-   Specify rows:

    ```{r results = "hide"}
    read_excel(deaths_path, range = cell_rows(c(5, 15)))
    ```

-   Specify cells that mark the top-left and bottom-right corners of the data -- the top-left corner, `A5`, translates to `c(5, 1)` (5th row down, 1st column) and the bottom-right corner, `F15`, translates to `c(15, 6)`:

    ```{r results = "hide"}
    read_excel(deaths_path, range = cell_limits(c(5, 1), c(15, 6)))
    ```

If you have control over the sheet, an even better way is to create a "named range".
This is useful within Excel because named ranges help repeat formulas easier to create and they have some useful properties for creating dynamic charts and graphs as well.
Even if you're not working in Excel, named ranges can be useful for identifying which cells to read into R.
In the example above, the table we're reading in is named `Table1`, so we can read it in with the following.

**TO DO:** Add this once reading in named ranges are implemented in readxl.

### Data types

In CSV files, all values are strings.
This is not particularly true to the data, but it is simple: everything is a string.

The underlying data in Excel spreadsheets is more complex.
A cell can be one of five things:

-   A logical, like TRUE / FALSE

-   A number, like "10" or "10.5"

-   A date, which can also include time like "11/1/21" or "11/1/21 3:00 PM"

-   A string, like "ten"

-   A currency, which allows numeric values in a limited range and four decimal digits of fixed precision

When working with spreadsheet data, it's important to keep in mind that how the underlying data is stored can be very different than what you see in the cell.
For example, Excel has no notion of an integer.
All numbers are stored as floating points, but you can choose to display the data with a customizable number of decimal points.
Similarly, dates are actually stored as numbers, specifically the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.
You can customize how you display the date by applying formatting in Excel.
Confusingly, it's also possible to have something that looks like a number but is actually a string (e.g. type `'10` into a cell in Excel).

These differences between how the underlying data are stored vs. how they're displayed can cause surprises when the data are loaded into R.
By default readxl will guess the data type in a given column.
A recommended workflow is to let readxl guess the column types, confirm that you're happy with the guessed column types, and if not, go back and re-import specifying `col_types` as shown in Section \@ref(reading-spreadsheets).

Another challenge is when you have a column in your Excel spreadsheet that has a mix of these types, e.g. some cells are numeric, others text, others dates.
When importing the data into R readxl has to make some decisions.
In these cases you can set the type for this column to `"list"`, which will load the column as a list of length 1 vectors, where the type of each element of the vector is guessed.

### Data not in cell values

**tidyxl** is useful for importing non-tabular data from Excel files into R.
For example, tidyxl doesn't coerce a pivot table into a data frame.
See <https://nacnudus.github.io/spreadsheet-munging-strategies/> for more on strategies for working with non-tabular data from Excel.

### Writing to Excel

Let's create a small data frame that we can then write out.
Note that `item` is a factor and `quantity` is an integer.

```{r}
bake_sale <- tibble(
  item     = factor(c("brownie", "cupcake", "cookie")),
  quantity = c(10, 5, 8)
)

bake_sale
```

You can write data back to disk as an Excel file using the `write_xlsx()` from the **writexl** package.

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(writexl)
write_xlsx(bake_sale, path = "data/bake-sale.xlsx")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:bake-sale-excel) shows what the data looks like in Excel.
Note that column names are included and bolded.
These can be turned off by setting `col_names` and `format_headers` arguments to `FALSE`.

```{r bake-sale-excel, fig.alt = "Bake sale data frame created earlier in Excel.", fig.cap = "Spreadsheet called bake_sale.xlsx in Excel.", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/import-spreadsheets-bake-sale.png")
```

Just like reading from a CSV, information on data type is lost when we read the data back in.
This makes Excel files unreliable for caching interim results as well.
For alternatives, see Section \@ref(writing-to-a-file).

```{r}
read_excel("data/bake-sale.xlsx")
```

### Formatted output

The readxl package is a light-weight solution for writing a simple Excel spreadsheet, but if you're interested in additional features like writing to sheets within a spreadsheet and styling, you will want to use the **openxlsx** package.
Note that this package is not part of the tidyverse so the functions and workflows may feel unfamiliar.
For example, function names are camelCase, multiple functions can't be composed in pipelines, and arguments are in a different order than they tend to be in the tidyverse.
However, this is ok.
As your R learning and usage expands outside of this book you will encounter lots of different styles used in various R packages that you might need to use to accomplish specific goals in R.
A good way of familiarizing yourself with the coding style used in a new package is to run the examples provided in function documentation to get a feel for the syntax and the output formats as well as reading any vignettes that might come with the package.

Below we show how to write a spreadsheet with three sheets, one for each species of penguins in the `penguins` data frame.

```{r message = FALSE}
library(openxlsx)
library(palmerpenguins)

# Create a workbook (spreadsheet)
penguins_species <- createWorkbook()

# Add three sheets to the spreadsheet
addWorksheet(penguins_species, sheetName = "Adelie")
addWorksheet(penguins_species, sheetName = "Gentoo")
addWorksheet(penguins_species, sheetName = "Chinstrap")

# Write data to each sheet
writeDataTable(
  penguins_species,
  sheet = "Adelie",
  x = penguins %>% filter(species == "Adelie")
)
writeDataTable(
  penguins_species,
  sheet = "Gentoo",
  x = penguins %>% filter(species == "Gentoo")
)
writeDataTable(
  penguins_species,
  sheet = "Chinstrap",
  x = penguins %>% filter(species == "Chinstrap")
)
```

This creates a workbook object:

```{r}
penguins_species
```

And we can write this to this with `saveWorkbook()`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
saveWorkbook(penguins_species, "data/penguins-species.xlsx")
```

The resulting spreadsheet is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:penguins-species).
By default, openxlsx formats the data as an Excel table.

```{r penguins-species, fig.alt = "A look at the penguins spreadsheet in Excel. The spreadsheet contains has three sheets: Torgersen Island, Biscoe Island, and Dream Island.", fig.cap = "Spreadsheet called penguins.xlsx in Excel.", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/import-spreadsheets-penguins-species.png")
```

See <https://ycphs.github.io/openxlsx/articles/Formatting.html> for an extensive discussion on further formatting functionality for data written from R to Excel with openxlsx.

### Exercises

1.  Recreate the `bake_sale` data frame, write it out to an Excel file using the `write.xlsx()` function from the openxlsx package.
2.  What happens if you try to read in a file with `.xlsx` extension with `read_xls()`?
