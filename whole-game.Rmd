# 소개 {#explore-intro}

이 책의 첫번째 파트는 데이터 **불러오기**, **정리하기**, 데이터 **탐색하기** 를 포함하는 데이터 과학 워크플로를 소개한다.
데이터 탐색이란 데이터를 보고, 빠르게 가설들을 만들고, 빠르게 가설들을 테스트한 뒤 이를 계속 계속 반복하는 기술이다.
데이터 탐색의 목적은 깊게 살펴볼 가능성있는 단서들을 만들어내는 데에 있다.

이 파트에서 즉각적으로 도움이 되는 유용한 도구들을 배울 것이다:

-   시각화는 바로 도움이 되기 때문에, R 프로그래밍을 시작하기 좋은 주제이다. Visualisation is a great place to start with R programming, because the payoff is so clear: you get to make elegant and informative plots that help you understand data.
    \@ref(data-visualization) 장에서 you'll dive into visualisation, learning the basic structure of a ggplot2 plot, and powerful techniques for turning data into plots.

-   Visualisation alone is typically not enough, so in Chapter \@ref(data-transform) you'll learn the key verbs that allow you to select important variables, filter out key observations, create new variables, and compute summaries.

-   In Chapter \@ref(data-tidy), you'll learn about tidy data, a consistent way of storing your data that makes transformation, visualisation, and modelling easier.
    You'll learn the underlying principles, and how to get your data into a tidy form.

-   Before you can transform and visualise your data, you need to first get your data into R.
    In Chapter \@ref(data-import) you'll learn the basics of getting plain-text, rectangular data into R.

-   Finally, in Chapter \@ref(exploratory-data-analysis), you'll combine visualisation and transformation with your curiosity and scepticism to ask and answer interesting questions about data.

Modelling is an important part of the exploratory process, but you don't have the skills to effectively learn or apply it yet and details of modeling fall outside the scope of this book.

Nestled among these five chapters that teach you the tools for doing data science are three chapters that focus on your R workflow.
In Chapters \@ref(workflow-basics), \@ref(workflow-scripts), and \@ref(workflow-projects), you'll learn good workflow practices for writing and organising your R code.
These will set you up for success in the long run, as they'll give you the tools to stay organised when you tackle real projects.
